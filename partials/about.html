<strong>What is a t-shirt quilt?</strong>

<p>Most of us accumulate a pile of treasured t-shirts over the course of our lives, storing them in boxes and shelves. These shirts are precious mementos of events or phases, and although we can't bear to part with them, we can't really find anything to do with them either. The shirts then become just another box in the attic, gathering dust out of sight.
<p>A t-shirt quilt is a great solution to this problem. It's a quilt pieced together with t-shirts or other fabrics, perfect for hanging on walls or covering couches and beds. Instead of keeping your prized memories trapped in the attic where they are simply a nuisance that must be stored, you can transform them into a beautiful decoration that you can appreciate for years to come. T-shirt quilts make great gifts, especially for graduating kids. It is common to make with shirts from a specific group that you were involved in, such as a club, school, or sorority.

<p><Strong>What exactly does Happy Dance Quilting do?</strong>

<p>We recieve your t-shirts and turn them into a beautiful and unique quilt for you. This involves cutting the front (or back) of t-shirts into usable squares, attaching them to form a quilt top, and machine quilting it together with batting and a backing fabric to make a complete quilt. We machine quilt all of our products fully for maximum quality. Certain extras can be added, such as sashing or variegated thread. All the customer has to do is ship their t-shirts to us and we will have it completed within five weeks!

As such, we are very experienced and committed to quality, as both professionals and hobbyists. We treat our customers with respect and produce the best product we can. Rest assured that you will be in good hands with us!

<p><Strong>Where does the name "Happy Dance Quilting" come from?</strong>

<p>The last stage of creating our own personal quilts usually involves spreading a quilt out on the floor to look at it. Our resident 4-pound Chihuahua and crown princess, Bella, for some reason finds this so exciting that she races into the room and dances around on the quilt in what we have dubbed The Happy Dance. We know then that it is a real Happy Dance Approved quilt. Worry not, though we keep our dog quite clean, she is only allowed to dance on our own quilts! We keep others' quilts in well-vacuumed rooms and storage bins. Bella's Happy Dance Approval can be obtained upon request, however.
