<div>
You can choose to have either single-color thread at no charge or one of our fancier
variegated (multi-color) threads for {{ctrl.getVariegatedThreadPrice() | currency}}. We will choose
the thread color that works best with your quilt.

<div ng-repeat="r in orderModel.getThreads()" ng-click="ctrl.setThread($index)">
