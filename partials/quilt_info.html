<strong>About Quilts</strong>

Knowing the underlined terms in particular will help the ordering process.

Your quilt will be made out of 15‚Äù squares called <em>blocks</em>. These will be cut from the shirts (or occasionally other fabrics) you provide. Each side of an adult-sized shirt can provide one block, though if a shirt is very small we may only be able to get one block out of it. Shirts of any material can be used; they do not have to be cotton.
</div>

<div>
<em>Sashing</em> is the fabric between blocks on certain quilts. This is an optional step and can make a t-shirt quilt look more formal or fancy. Sashing strips are about an inch and a half wide each, and thus add to both the length and width of the quilt.
</div>

<div>
A quilt consists of three parts:

<ol>
<li>The quilt top. This is pieced together from blocks and sashing (if chosen).</li>
<li>The batting, which is the fluffy insulation in between the quilt top and backing.</li>
<li>The backing, which is the fabric on the back of the quilt. This will be a solid color fabric of your choosing. If the quilt is sashed, this should generally match the sashing fabric.</li>
</ol>

Please click on the "samples" button on the toolbar to see some examples of quilts of different sizes, with and without sashing.
